# sheConnect

sheConnect is a virtual anonymous app. Women can post their problems, doubts, and ideas. To every question asked, other women users from across the globe can comment, answer, upvote or downvote. The novelty of the app is that the identity of the user is never revealed to anyone so women can freely discuss their problems without the fear being judged and no abusive words/images can be uploaded. Also the app will be secured using login credentials to ensure integrity.
This application uses Firebase as backend and basic tensorflow for analysing images.
